# Roblox Group Activity Logger
simple activity logger for roblox places with discord webhook

All groupID, StaffRank and discors webhooks provided in the script must be changed, as they will log a sample group, not yours.

# Discord webhooks will not work.
You need to paste your webhook into https://hooks.hyra.io/ and generate one from the proxy. Discord PTB webhooks are also supported under the fixed condidtion that a Hyra hook is used. **AS OF 2025 THE HYRA PROXY NO LONGER WORKS.** I do not plan on looking for an alternative proxy and will be archiving this repository. You're on your own with this one.

# Final Product
If you've done setup correctly, a message like this one will be logged in your selected webhook channel.
