# Roblox Group Activity Logger
simple activity logger for roblox places with discord webhook

All groupID, StaffRank and discors webhooks provided in the script must be changed, as they will log a sample group, not yours.

# "Bare" Discord webhooks will not work.
You need to paste your webhook into a webhook proxy for them to work due to Roblox-side restrictions. Use the proxy at https://webhook.lewisakura.moe/. The webhook generated is the one you must use in order for ActivityLogger to work.

# Final Product
If you've done setup correctly, a message like this one will be logged in your selected webhook channel.
